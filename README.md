# Overview



The goal of this project was to make a small car that will avoid obstacles by turning. The
car will take in sensory input(through the distance sensor), will have one button to turn
the car on, and one to switch on a light on the car. This satisfies all of the criteria for
the project. This project will incorporate ADCs, interrupts and GPIO in order to correctly
work. I designed this project because I think it will be really cool to pull off something like
this.
